Assignements are done in A'1-10' you should be looking at Assignment_X_ARDA.ipynb etc for the projects.

Sessions are pulled code from Brightspace (School resource)

ML_2023 is code relevant to the book (Aurélien-Géron-Hands...) in the main directory is unorganized but all tools are there

If you have trouble viewing certain texts or code use Anaconda's Jupyter notbook

Case studies in the A'1-10' folders should be read before attempting to understand the Assignments
